
REview:

Testing:TO imrove the quality
to find the defect

How: Manually/automation


When:

As soon the requimrents are freeezed

When to stop 
no critical /major functionalities are without defects
Time
Budget
Customer Satisfaction


Testing is an never ending process

7 principles of testing:

1.prsence of defects:
2.Early Testing
3.Exhaustive Testing
it is possible but impratical to complete
4.pesticide paradox:

Tc1-----tc10


5.defect clustering-->80-20
6.content dependent
7.Absence of errors/fallacy

REquirment Analysis

Development
Testing
Implementation/deploymnet
Maintenance

Level of Testing:

DEvelopement---testing--maintenance
unit--Integration--system--UAT


Models:

1.Sequential----------------> waterfall anmd v model
2.Iterative and incremental----> prototype, spiral, agile

Waterfall
Vmodel
Prototype
Spiral
Agile

Waterfall

1.Change in Requirments will not accepted during the middle of the process
2.The client will be not allowed to view/review the process during the midlle of the process


Advantages:
1.the people.tech will be clear in what to do
2. Cost of implemntation is not high

Disadvantages:
Testing is done only once
Client sees the project only at the end stage , so the change in requiment will be very high
Time consuming, Documentation


V-model

Both testing and Development will take place in parallel

SDLC
LEvel of testing

Requirment analysis--------->SRS
DEsign--------> HLD---LLD
Develop--Working software

REquirment----------------UAT Testing------> Test plan, Test case
(SRs)

HLD----------------->System Testing-Test plan and Test cases

LLD------------> unit Testing and integration ---tst plan and test cases


unit modeules---------> Unit Testing/Integrtatio
system Testing-------> Functional and non funn
UAT Testing

Advantages:

Changed in REquest will be accepts
Testing is done at every level
Complex 
Disadvantages:
Reqauirnent shoule be clear
Documenmtation correctioon will be high

Iterative Approach

Business Analyst -------> user stories

As a user
I want to send messsages to people in my contact
so that I can start my communication
